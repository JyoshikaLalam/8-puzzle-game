1. Import Necessary Libraries.
 
<!-- 
import numpy as np
import math
import time
 -->

2. Define the Start and Goal States.

<!-- 
start = np.array([4, 1, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 0, 6]).reshape(3, 3)
goal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0]).reshape(3, 3)
 -->

3. Define the Functions to generate possible Moves.

<!-- 
def actions_array(array)
 -->

4. Define the Heuristic Function.

<!-- 
def h_value(array)
 -->

5. Define the Main Function.

<!-- 
def main()
 -->

6. Execute main.
